        <h2>Q3.Event Loop In Javascript?</h2>
        <p>We Know JavaScript is a synchronous, blocking, single-threaded language.This means only one
           operation can be in progress <br>at a time.But event loop in a mechanism that allows Javascript to perform no-blocking 
           operations.When an asynchronous<br>task is started the event loop will start running.When the task is completed the event 
           loop will again check for any other tasks<br> that need to be performed.This process will continue until all tasks have been completed.
